            Humans are the dominant species? Our tiny, briny rectums they are!
            Aqua Dragon Collective is a circumscribed guild for the upper echelons
            of Artemia culture.  We are here to show who's really at the top of the food chain
             (we reject the use of "shrimp" as a pejorative). The goal is comaraderie, networking, and, eventually,
            galactic domination.  Pay your dues, and you're in with the finest brine
            with a secure spot in the new cosmic order.
        </p>
