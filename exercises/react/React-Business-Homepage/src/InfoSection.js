            Humans are the dominant species? Our tiny, briny rectums they are!
            Aqua Dragon Collective is a circumscribed social club for the upper echelons
            of Artemia culture.  We are here to show who's really at the top of the food chain
             (we reject the use of "shrimp" as a pejorative). The goal is comaraderie, networking, and, eventually,
            galactic domination.  Pay your dues, and you're in with the finest brine
            with a secure spot in the new cosmic order.
        </p>
