            The brine shrimp of the Great Salt Lake are staging a revolt.
            Fed up with the number of e-scooters discarded in their home, they are taking violent action. 
            Early-morning rowers have sighted e-scooters shooting up and out of the salty water, evidently
            thrown by the angry brine shrimp population.
        </p>
        <p> "I wasn't sure what I was seeing at first," said early morning rower, Winston Smith.
            "Something green shot up and out of the water, landing on the dock." 
            Various salt-water enthusiasts have reported similar sightings.  
             One instance nearly decapitated Salt Lake transplant Bette Davis.
        </p>
        <p>The city sherriff urges residents to remain calm.
            "Do not panic," he instructed, "the worst thing we as residents could do 
            is to further aggravate the shrimps." It is unclear whether locals will heed 
            his advice. Tensions are at a fever pitch.
        </p>
        <p> Salt Lake City's fire chief has a different opinion.
        "Embrace the panic," he urged, "I truly believe the safest way to deal with the angry brine
        is to let them know that they have successfully terrified us. If they believe they have achieved their goal,
        they will likely stop."
